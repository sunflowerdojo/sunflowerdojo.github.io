Give users the ability to escape any system notifications, with no strings attached. Notifications should respect the users' freedoms. Please refrain

<!--more-->

Either force updates to occur on a system, or give users the freedom to update whenever they please. Establish consistent interaction patterns.

### Passive-aggressive model: Apple Mac OS X

Apple cannot bring themselves to aggressively force their end-users to update. Therefore, they give users the option to defer updates every day.

<figure id="attachment_211" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211" style="width: 332px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-211" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1.png" alt="" width="332" height="63" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1.png 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211" class="wp-caption-text">"This window is going to pop-up again, and you, the user, will be forced to interact with in on a daily basis until you do what we want, which is update your system."</figcaption></figure>

The closest option to "stop bothering me about this" is the "Later" option in the sub-menu which appears when I press "Install."

Another example of a forced interaction is the dialogue the system threw in my face when a new version of Safari was released. I don't really care that Safari was updated. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tell me in the application when I open it that it's been updated.</span> I want Safari to do what I expect it to do, when I run it. I don't need it to be doing things while I'm not using it.

<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-212" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg" alt="" width="549" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads-300x92.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Apple can't seem to find the space to let its users say, "Get this out of my face, permanently." But the new Safari is so relevant to our users! Hint: It's not.</figcaption></figure>

### Model which respects users' attention: Gnome Desktop, Linux

Your mileage may vary when it comes to Linux, but system notifications, since they are show in actual application windows, and not special "Look at meeee!" popups, have a safe "out": The "Close window" button, X.

<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-213" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="406" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater.jpg 606w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater-300x262.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">By BenBen1234 (Self-photographed, derivative work) [GPL (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)], via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>In the above dialogue, the application designer even thought to include a "Close" button. You mean, I can update a few days from now, and you won't nag me every day about it?

### The machine is ours when you're done with it: Microsoft Windows

Microsoft gives its users plenty of leeway for installing updates: "Do your daily work, but when you're finished, we'll take over and keep your machine running while we update, since we can assume that by shutting down or restarting your machine, you are finished with it."

The caveat of course is that I don't only shutdown my machine when I am finished with it, I often need to restart because of system errors, memory issues, computer running slowly, or an update can only be installed when the system restarts.

At least Microsoft takes a clear stance.
