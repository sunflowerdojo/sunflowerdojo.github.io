Give users the ability to escape any system notifications, with no strings attached. Notifications should respect the users&#8217; freedoms. Please refrain

<!--more-->

Either force updates to occur on a system, or give users the freedom to update whenever they please. Establish consistent interaction patterns.

### Passive-aggressive model: Apple Mac OS X

Apple cannot bring themselves to aggressively force their end-users to update. Therefore, they give users the option to defer updates every day.

<figure id="attachment_211" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211" style="width: 332px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-211" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1.png" alt="" width="332" height="63" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1.png 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware1-300x57.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-211" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;This window is going to pop-up again, and you, the user, will be forced to interact with in on a daily basis until you do what we want, which is update your system.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>

The closest option to &#8220;stop bothering me about this&#8221; is the &#8220;Later&#8221; option in the sub-menu which appears when I press &#8220;Install.&#8221;

Another example of a forced interaction is the dialogue the system threw in my face when a new version of Safari was released. I don&#8217;t really care that Safari was updated. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tell me in the application when I open it that it&#8217;s been updated.</span> I want Safari to do what I expect it to do, when I run it. I don&#8217;t need it to be doing things while I&#8217;m not using it.

<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-212" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg" alt="" width="549" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg 549w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads-300x92.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Apple can&#8217;t seem to find the space to let its users say, &#8220;Get this out of my face, permanently.&#8221; But the new Safari is so relevant to our users! Hint: It&#8217;s not.</figcaption></figure>

### Model which respects users&#8217; attention: Gnome Desktop, Linux

Your mileage may vary when it comes to Linux, but system notifications, since they are show in actual application windows, and not special &#8220;Look at meeee!&#8221; popups, have a safe &#8220;out&#8221;: The &#8220;Close window&#8221; button, X.

<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-213" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="406" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater.jpg 606w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ubuntu_updater-300x262.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">By BenBen1234 (Self-photographed, derivative work) [GPL (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)], via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>In the above dialogue, the application designer even thought to include a &#8220;Close&#8221; button. You mean, I can update a few days from now, and you won&#8217;t nag me every day about it?

### The machine is ours when you&#8217;re done with it: Microsoft Windows

Microsoft gives its users plenty of leeway for installing updates: &#8220;Do your daily work, but when you&#8217;re finished, we&#8217;ll take over and keep your machine running while we update, since we can assume that by shutting down or restarting your machine, you are finished with it.&#8221;

The caveat of course is that I don&#8217;t only shutdown my machine when I am finished with it, I often need to restart because of system errors, memory issues, computer running slowly, or an update can only be installed when the system restarts.

At least Microsoft takes a clear stance.
