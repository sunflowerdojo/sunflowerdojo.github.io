  - Apps Behaving Badly
---
I trust my oven because it always bakes the way I expect. I trust my refridgerator because it always keeps my food cold.

I don&#8217;t trust computers because they lose files, stop working, crash, reboot, forget what I&#8217;m doing, and every few years I have to buy a new one because the old one can&#8217;t keep up.

Computers look like appliances, but don&#8217;t behave like them. They are wolves in sheeps&#8217; clothing. They cannot be trusted.

There is a certain amount of fault tolerance we are expected to have while using computers. The ever-present array of mysterious crashes, reboots, freezes, tells us that computers will never be perfectly robotic, perfectly mechanical: they will never be perfectly obedient and always reserve the right to go haywire or act unexpectedly.

Today, in the middle of my work day, on my computer, my office software suite of choice prompted me to download an update. No problem, I can download while I work. I worked, it downloaded from a trusted source. I opened the downloaded file, and the fonts on my screen changed to garbled text and the computer hard-locked. I had to reboot it and lost all my work.

On reboot, the operating system told me, &#8220;You restarted as a result of a crash. Do you want to open the windows from before?&#8221;

No. I want _you_, Apple, to give me a stable computing experience. The system did not offer to file a bug report or to send a crash report to Apple. It simply sent me on my way.

The crash is not the office suite&#8217;s fault. It may not even be Chrome&#8217;s fault (the browser I used to download).

What the industry expects is for my _fault tolerance_ to kick in and absorb this very bad behavior from their product.

The problem is that things like this happen _all the time_. Buggy software, strange behavior, applications quitting unexpectedly, has always been the _norm_. That is, few if any companies have ever got the stability and dependability of the personal computer experience up to 100% reliability.

## The small instabilities are frightening

What&#8217;s very interesting to me is that 80 percent of the time, my computer is stable. It&#8217;s the other 10-20 percent of my experiences that keep me at arm&#8217;s length from computers.

&#8220;Back up your work.&#8221; &#8220;Make backups.&#8221; &#8220;Did you save your files?&#8221; &#8220;Did you use <name of cloud file storage service here>?&#8221;

Examples of computers and software behaving in a way as to destroy trust:

  * Mozilla Firefox tabs stopped responding. The app then crashed. Multiple times in a row in one day.
  * My iMac rebooted three times in a row in five seconds for no apparent reason.
  * Chrome crashed unexpectedly.
  * Mac Finder stopped responding for no reason, froze, and restarted a minute later.
  * Mac System Preferences pane stopped responding.
  * Couldn&#8217;t log out of my Mac.
  * An important file disappeared from my computer and wasn&#8217;t in any automated backups.
  * The &#8220;Wait&#8221; mouse icon spins on the screen at any given time for a random number of seconds.
  * No login screen after waking computer from &#8220;sleep&#8221;

Hmm! Could be faulty hardware, you say? Insufficient resources (8 GB isn&#8217;t enough)? Maybe I need to re-install my operating system &#8230;

Reinstall my operating system &#8230;

There is something common to operating system design that is fundamentally flawed and requires an occasional reboot to &#8220;clear things up.&#8221; There is something that modern operating system development teams aren&#8217;t doing to iron out this permanent &#8220;bump&#8221; in the experience of using a computer. I am sure that:

## There is an elephant in my computer.
