Give users the ability to escape any system notifications, with no strings attached. Notifications should respect users&#8217; freedoms. And no more daily nags!

<!--more-->

Either force updates to occur on a system, or give users the freedom to update whenever they please. Establish consistent interaction patterns.

Today&#8217;s evaluation: system updates!

### Bar sleaze model: Apple Mac OS X

Apple forces their users to accept the interaction or procrastinate, with no option to disengage. Apple&#8217;s strategy is to wear down their users and won&#8217;t take no for an answer. All it needs is to greet its users on login with &#8220;Hey beautiful, can I buy you a drink?&#8221;

The closest option to &#8220;stop asking me to let you touch my files&#8221; is the &#8220;Later&#8221; option in the sub-menu which appears when I press &#8220;Install.&#8221;

Another example of a forced interaction is the dialogue the system threw in my face when a new version of Safari was released. I don&#8217;t really care that Safari was updated. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tell me in the application when I open it that it&#8217;s been updated.</span> I want Safari to do what I expect it to do, when I run it. I don&#8217;t need it to be doing things while I&#8217;m not using it.

<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-212" src="https://www.sunflowerdojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg" alt="" width="549" height="169" srcset="https://www.sunflowerdojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads.jpeg 549w, https://www.sunflowerdojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nagware2_system_ads-300x92.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Apple can&#8217;t seem to handle rejection and won&#8217;t let its users choose the &#8220;Get out of my face, permanently&#8221; option. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been friends for so long. I&#8217;m a Nice OS!&#8221; Hint: It&#8217;s not.</figcaption></figure>

### It&#8217;s ours whenever we want it: Microsoft Windows

Microsoft&#8217;s model used to be, &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-forced-windows-update-auto-restart-snooze-indefinitely-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We&#8217;re going to update whenever we want, even if you&#8217;re in the middle of something</a>.&#8221; The internet has many such discussions in which Windows users express their rage towards Microsoft&#8217;s forced update interactions.

Still, Microsoft takes the initiative on updates when it thinks the user has given consent (shutdown/restart is implied consent), and doesn&#8217;t care about misinterpretation: &#8220;When you say yes, I&#8217;m starting, and you can&#8217;t back out.&#8221;

The problem is the interpretation of update opportunity. I don&#8217;t only shutdown my machine when I am finished with it, I often need to restart because of system errors, memory issues, computer running slowly &#8212; something performance-related.

Microsoft should provide a third option, &#8220;Restart with updates&#8221; or &#8220;Shutdown with updates.&#8221;

### Model which respects users&#8217; choices: Gnome Desktop, Linux

Your mileage may vary when it comes to Linux, but system notifications, since they are shown in actual application windows, are not special &#8220;Look at meeee!&#8221; popups; they have a safe &#8220;out&#8221;: The &#8220;Close window&#8221; button, X.

You mean, I can call you back a few days from now, and you won&#8217;t nag me every day about it until I do?
