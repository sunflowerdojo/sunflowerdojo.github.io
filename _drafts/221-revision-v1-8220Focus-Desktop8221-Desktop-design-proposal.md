I propose a new set of rules for applications to follow and standards of application focus in a system I call the "Focus Desktop Environment."

<!--more-->

Mission statement:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>The mission of Focus Desktop Environment (Focus DE)<br /> </strong><strong>is to preserve the user's focus on their active task<br /> andÂ <em>never</em> disrupt it.</strong>
</p>
