My common web experience is to visit a new site, close a modal, and start reading whatever I came to read.

Often, somewhere in the beginning or middle of the article, another modal pops up, and tells me something.

Sometimes, when I finish an article, there's a modal popover inviting me to subscribe or read a related article.

Now, when I visit a new site with modal popovers, I simply close the tab and go to another site.

<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/modal-windows-in-modern-web-design/" target="_blank">This</a> 2009 article from Smashing Magazine lists good practices for modals. However, to no fault of their own, the author says that modals are good for alerts.

No. Just no. Alerts should _never_ obstruct the user's experience or viewing area.

Do you want to alert your users? <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html" target="_blank">Use a toast</a>, which "automatically disappear[s] after a timeout."
