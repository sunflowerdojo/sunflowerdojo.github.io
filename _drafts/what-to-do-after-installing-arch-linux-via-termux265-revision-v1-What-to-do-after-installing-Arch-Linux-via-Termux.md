Brief recap: [How to install Arch Linux on Android via Termux](https://sdrausty.github.io/TermuxArch/docs/install)

After installing, run &#8220;tour&#8221; to get some helpful aliases set up, and then run &#8220;keys&#8221; to get all the official keyrings needed for installing packages.

Without keys, attempts to install packages will fail with errors about corrupt keyrings/no trust.
