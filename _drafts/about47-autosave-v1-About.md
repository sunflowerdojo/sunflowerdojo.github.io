I&#8217;m a software developer with a background in startups and the arts. I&#8217;ve worn many hats and I&#8217;ve landed at software developer because I enjoy using tech to &#8220;make life easier&#8221; for people and as a creator I like the blend of artistic and technical challenges that this role holds. Software can be a powerful force for positive, civic change when done well, and when done poorly or in service to unethical forces, destroys public trust and well-being.

The software world is plagued with inconsistencies and pain. Bugs in large pieces of enterprise software sit around for years and years. &#8220;Surely I can do better than that!&#8221;

**History**

I wrote my first program on an Apple IIe. It was with Logo. It sparked my connection to technology. I started playing computer games and then found out I could create my own. I then wrote a text-based &#8220;choose your own adventure,&#8221; in Basic, since I loved reading and interactive games. The next software I wrote was on an IBM 286 using Basic and I wrote a post-apocalyptic text-based interactive story, with some action elements.

My interest in computer games led me to hex editors that made it so I could edit the games I was playing and modify them, adding content, changing physics parameters, and finding secrets. One particular secret I remember digging up was inspecting the executable file for a game called &#8220;A-Train&#8221;, and in it all the developers had left their names, as well as comments to each other.

Fast-forward to high school and the emergence of the internet. I was on IRC writing &#8220;trivia bots&#8221; that asked questions and listened for answers. I used the trivia bot to create questions based around the lives of the members that frequented my fantasy and science fiction roleplaying chat rooms, so that we could remember fun and important things about each other. I also discovered text-based music composition software and HTML, and created websites featuring my own music. I did the same for cartoons, a passion of mine, but got plagiarized by a more business-minded individual, and quit drawing.
