This post will be continuously updated with my findings in a number of categories. I am interesting in finding programming languages that are powerful and bring in more new features than they do repeat the old way of doing things. I do not consider closed-source solutions, only open source projects with collaborative licenses.

Categories:

  * Visual programming languages
  * Written programming languages designed to address the problems of the day, not the problems of 20 years ago
  * Technologies that facilitate open collaboration and learning

## Visual programming languages

I think that having to type lines of code is something that should be automated, and instead of futzing through conditionals, loops, and other repeatable activities like type checking, error handling, I think it&#8217;s a better use of time to program with symbols and use visuals to express the flows of the application.

This looks promising. Its premise is drawing flow diagrams instead of writing code. But the source code is not publicly available.

## Text Programming Languages

These languages bring something new to the table.

The author of the language describes it as &#8220;secure distributed persistent language  
for capability-based smart contracting&#8221;. The rationale behind its development is compelling. E language has a Java implementation and [a Lisp implementation](https://github.com/kpreid/e-on-cl). The Java release is 0.9, and there is as yet no official Lisp release.

Angle is &#8220;the Python implementation of [English](https://github.com/pannous/english-script) as a programming language.&#8221; Personally I find this project extremely compelling because I have long believed that:

  * the barrier to programming computers is too high
  * personal computing assistants are terrible
  * the computer should bend itself to accommodate the user, not the other way around

I share the same visions as the author of English-Script and I am happy to list this one here.
