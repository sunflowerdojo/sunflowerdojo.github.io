I can operate my Macbook in &#8220;closed-shell&#8221; mode but I never knew about it until I accidentally shut my laptop with my external monitor plugged in &#8230; and my monitor stayed on, to my surprise.

However, it took some searching to discover that this feature doesn&#8217;t work unless the Macbook is plugged in.

Therefore, there should be some notification on the external monitor: &#8220;For performance reasons, please plug in your laptop to use the external monitor in closed-shell mode. This display will turn off in 60 seconds&#8230;&#8221;

or 

&#8220;Plug in your laptop to continue to use closed-shell mode (use only this monitor). This display will automatically turn off in 60 .. 59 &#8230; 58&#8221;

The same way a lot of monitors today will auto-sleep if they don&#8217;t detect data coming in from a source.
