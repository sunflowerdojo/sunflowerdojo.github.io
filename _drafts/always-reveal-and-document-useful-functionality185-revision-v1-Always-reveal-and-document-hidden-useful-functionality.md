I can operate my Macbook in "closed-shell" mode but I never knew about it until I accidentally shut my laptop with my external monitor plugged in &#8230; and my monitor stayed on, to my surprise.

However, it took some searching to discover that this feature doesn't work unless the Macbook is plugged in.

Therefore, there should be some notification on the external monitor: "For performance reasons, please plug in your laptop to use the external monitor in closed-shell mode. This display will turn off in 60 seconds&#8230;"

or

"Plug in your laptop to continue to use closed-shell mode (use only this monitor). This display will automatically turn off in 60 .. 59 &#8230; 58"

The same way a lot of monitors today will auto-sleep if they don't detect data coming in from a source.
