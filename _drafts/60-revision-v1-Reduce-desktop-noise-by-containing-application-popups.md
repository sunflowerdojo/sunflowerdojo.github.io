Mac OS system designers introduced a Notifications panel some editions ago for the desktop OS. It&#8217;s supposed to be a place where applications can send their notifications instead of losing these notifications or overwhelming users with temporary bites of information.

However, enough applications seem to forget that there is a notifications panel that I too, as a user, completely forget that there is this _place_ for _notifications_ &#8212; an entire popout panel.

The notifications panel needs to be treated as a universal one-stop &#8220;place&#8221; for all system notifications.
