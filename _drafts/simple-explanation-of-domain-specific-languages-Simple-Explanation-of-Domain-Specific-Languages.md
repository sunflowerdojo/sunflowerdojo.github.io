A food recipe is a domain-specific language. So is MySQL (but arguably less palatable). High level overview only.

What is a domain?

A domain is just the topic for the problem, the subject matter of the area in which you&#8217;re working. For example, the domain of &#8220;making food in the kitchen&#8221; is called &#8220;cooking&#8221;.

A cooking recipe is a perfect example of a domain-specific language. It has terms like &#8220;sautee&#8221; and &#8220;roast&#8221; which areÂ  specific to the activity of cooking and have little meaning outside the domain (&#8220;Would you sautee the rug for me, please?&#8221;) A cooking recipe is also a nice type of human-readable scripting language which has a clear set of inputs and requirements (food ingredients, spices, utensils and containers needed), a clear order of operations (slice the onion before frying it), and indicates expected output (Blueberry Muffin recipe).

MySQL is a specific language (set of terms and particular style of grammar) written for the problem domain of &#8220;getting things in and out of a database.&#8221; It makes some linguistic sense (&#8220;Select everything from this table where this column has this value&#8221;) and provides a great interface to an experience that would otherwise force users to write many lines of human-unfriendly code to get what they want. It greatly lowers the barrier of entry to &#8220;getting things in and out of a database&#8221;.

Another example of a domain-specific language is HTML a type of template language. It has a set of terms to describe things in the domain (the topic) of &#8220;displaying web content to users&#8221; or more simply &#8220;webpages.&#8221; Header and footer don&#8217;t really make sense outside of the context of HTML (except for visual design and text documents). Template languages are domain-specific languages.

I&#8217;ve ordered Martin Fowler&#8217;s book on the subject and when I learn more, I&#8217;ll share my findings and synthesize the topic in greater depth.
