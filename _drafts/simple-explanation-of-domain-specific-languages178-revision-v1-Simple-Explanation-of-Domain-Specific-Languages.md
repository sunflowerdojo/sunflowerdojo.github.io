A food recipe is a domain-specific language. So is MySQL (but arguably less palatable). High level overview only.

What is a domain?

A domain is just the topic for the problem, the subject matter of the area in which you're working. For example, the domain of "making food in the kitchen" is called "cooking".

A cooking recipe is a perfect example of a domain-specific language. It has terms like "sautee" and "roast" which areÂ  specific to the activity of cooking and have little meaning outside the domain ("Would you sautee the rug for me, please?") A cooking recipe is also a nice type of human-readable scripting language which has a clear set of inputs and requirements (food ingredients, spices, utensils and containers needed), a clear order of operations (slice the onion before frying it), and indicates expected output (Blueberry Muffin recipe).

MySQL is a specific language (set of terms and particular style of grammar) written for the problem domain of "getting things in and out of a database." It makes some linguistic sense ("Select everything from this table where this column has this value") and provides a great interface to an experience that would otherwise force users to write many lines of human-unfriendly code to get what they want. It greatly lowers the barrier of entry to "getting things in and out of a database".

Another example of a domain-specific language is HTML a type of template language. It has a set of terms to describe things in the domain (the topic) of "displaying web content to users" or more simply "webpages." Header and footer don't really make sense outside of the context of HTML (except for visual design and text documents). Template languages are domain-specific languages.

I've ordered Martin Fowler's book on the subject and when I learn more, I'll share my findings and synthesize the topic in greater depth.
