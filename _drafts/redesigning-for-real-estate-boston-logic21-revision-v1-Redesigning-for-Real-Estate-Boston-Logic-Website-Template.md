I had the opportunity to work on a landing page mockup for <a href="http://www.bostonlogic.com/" target="_blank">Boston Logic</a>, an "online marketing and technology firm focused on the real estate industry." They provide database technology services as well as data analysis, lead generation, deal tracking and more, for real estate firms and agencies.

My first action was to evaluate the objectives of these landing page templates. They all appear to:

  * Suggest a personal brand of real estate agent, or firm,
  * Make the visitor feel like searching for listings is easy, (quick search form on the landing page)
  * Make the visitor feel like the listing are quality listings (good photography)

But what is the prime objective of a real estate website? _To sell real estate._ Therefore, the landing page must do everything possible to make the ideas of _searching_ and _buying_ real estate as attractive as possible. As well, if an agent is involved, the page needs to have personality so that visitors can connect immediately.

It would not do to create a 78th family member of these templates which all have similar layouts. I knew I had to create something unique. I redefined the goals of the landing page like so:

  1. Emphasize personality (make a template clearly different from all the others)
  2. Beautify search tool, make it dynamic by removing the "Search" button and therefore improving "user experience",
  3. Devote as much space as possible to beautiful, attractive listings.

I randomly chose a premade layout, shown on the left. I then carefully analyzed it to see where I could start to optimize the look and feel of the page by reducing unused space.

I calculated that approximately 30% of the page was empty, and less than a third of the site was devoted to showing listings.

In today's world of full-screen video, high-definition images, this statistic needed improvement.

## Phase 1: Personality, Header, Navigation

I took the colors from the Maxfield logo for the landing page's color scheme. I opted to move the agent portrait out of the landing page body and put it in the top navigation bar so that the face of the agent would have a permanent "presence." Visitors will now feel like the agent is "with them at all times", because the photo is physically on every page, creating a subconscious level of support.

I also retraced the bitmap image of the Maxwell logo into Illustrator and produced a vector image out of it to improve image quality.

<figure id="attachment_26" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26 size-full" src="http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-agent.jpg" alt="new-agent" width="236" height="158" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26" class="wp-caption-text">Updated agent profile (name is ficticious, stock portrait.)</figcaption></figure>

I chose to put the agent portrait in a round container, to improve friendliness of presentation (remove sharp edges), and round images are absolutely in fashion. I enlarged the agent's name to emphasize brand and ownership.

###### Navigation

I felt there were also too many menu items. These could be whittled down by hiding some of them in sub-menus, like so:

  * **Home** : Removed, redundant; visitors can go to the home page by clicking on the agent portrait or the brand logo, and this is common enough practice that it is expected behavior on modern websites.
  * **Sales** (Search): Too wordy, remove "Search", Sales is descriptive enough
  * **Rental** (search): Same for Sales, keep "Rental" and drop "Search". Save space!
  * **Developments**: Dropped in favor of "Luxury", developments is too long of a word
  * **About Us**: Kept, standard navigation item
    &mdash;**Blog** : This can be a submenu item of About Us, no reason to clog up the navigation, and it is an appropriate submenu item because it is common practice
    &mdash;**Contact Us**: Also common practice to put as a submenu item of About Us
  * **Offices**: Move this information to the "Contact Us" page
  * **Agents**: Keep, it provides a link to a page that shows other people, it allows visitors the idea and "power" of being able to "connect" with agents

##### Header

Contact information in the header is useful so that visitors can feel like they always have "access" to the agent. They will not have to click away from browsing listings in order to pick up the phone and call to get info on a listing.

Social media icons: As few as possible. The intention is productive but with so many sharing options it just looks cluttered. I opted to keep Facebook (large social market), Youtube (video content is an excellent way to engage visitors) and Twitter (small digestible "bites" of information). Keeping them in the header improves access to sharing.

I ended up with some extra space on the left, so I chose to put a paragraph blurb about the agent's accomplishments. This positions the agent as an authority figure and also provides a sense of reassurance. It was taking up space in the main "body" of the page, where real estate photos should be.

<figure id="attachment_22" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-22 size-large" src="http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-header-1024x155.jpg" alt="A new header I propose for the agent page." width="660" height="100" />](http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-header.jpg)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-22" class="wp-caption-text">Header and navigation redesign: Personality, simple and clear links, credentials, communication information, fixed to the top.</figcaption></figure>

With all of this information condensed into one area, the remaining portion of the landing page is free for search and listings.

## Phase 2: Optimize Search Experience

<figure id="attachment_27" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27" style="width: 105px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-27" src="http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/old-search-105x300.jpg" alt="Search bar from source template. Useful yet ready for a makeover." width="105" height="300" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-27" class="wp-caption-text">Search bar from source template. Useful yet ready for a makeover.</figcaption></figure>

Today's technology allows dynamic access to information. Removing clicks between the visitor and his/her objective drastically improves user experience. The sample layout offers simple, selectable options, but requires the visitor to click on Search. We can remove this click by using AJAX to dynamically load listings from the database; therefore, a submit button is no longer needed.

Think of AirBNB: Their search experience is so successful because results are returned dynamically. There are no obstacles. There is no waiting. The experience is seamless &mdash; it's time to improve user experience by drawing on this new technology.

I opted to move the search box from a vertical position to horizontal. This way there would be more horizontal space to show listings, which is a primary objective. By putting the search box just underneath the header, instead of on the side, visitors can focus their attention on the remaining 70% of the page.

##### Styling the search tools

I drew from mobile UI symbols and motifs to improve accessibility. I chose to keep the controls on a white background for elegance and to imply simplicity. Instead of entering price ranges manually, I put in a slider with low and high marks, which is common practice and will make the transition to mobile layout much easier.

<figure id="attachment_23" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-23" src="http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-search-1024x93.jpg" alt="Mobile UI-like search bar" width="660" height="60" />](http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-search.jpg)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-23" class="wp-caption-text">Search tools to increase user enjoyment and experience. Min BR and BATH are dropdown selectors.</figcaption></figure>

Real estate agents can decide if they want to add more filters or not through the "More Filters" option (again think AirBNB), so that the screen is not a visual mess. Hide extra content.

The search results will appear automatically, responding automatically to changes in the search query (with a 2-second delay so as not to overwhelm the database).

## Phase 3: Beautify and Enlarge Search Results

The original template was on to something good, especially in describing just a few attributes of the property in order to provide a "taste." Now that the sidebar is out of the way, as well as all the agent content, it's the perfect opportunity to fill the screen with elegant results.

I chose to start with a 3-wide, 2-high grid of listings. This provided the perfect balance between size and quantity. A 2-wide grid would be too large and would not provide enough variation (immediately) to make it engaging. More than 3-wide shrank the listings down too small, they lost their visual appeal.

<figure id="attachment_24" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24" style="width: 338px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-24 size-full" src="http://cabriolegraphics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-listing.jpg" alt="New, elegant listing" width="338" height="227" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-24" class="wp-caption-text">Updated, elegant listing.</figcaption></figure>

I drew from the original template's way of listing information, and used the new width of listings to my advantage, creating a sense of elegance and space through minimalism.

The status of a property (for rent or sale) is shown on the right, to help clarify search results.

# Final Result

Overall I feel this updated design reflects today's design knowledge, improved aesthetics, improved user experience, branding and messaging and provides massive value as a single-page search tool, while still retaining some of the feel of the previous template.
