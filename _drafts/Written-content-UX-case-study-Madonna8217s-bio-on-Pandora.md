In this post I examine the text of a biography of a well-known artist on a well-known music streaming service, and show how user experience design can improve the copy.

## Writing Persona: Voice and Tone

Let&#8217;s define some characteristics of the writing persona for this project. I&#8217;ll be writing about a female pop star, a cultural icon. Our target audience may be a general audience, and may include Madonna fans already; therefore the voice and tone should be broadly appealing, and _active_. I&#8217;ll choose some characteristics:

  * **Energetic**: This artist has a tremendous amount of energy, has produced a high volume of work, and has had a long career. The writing should be energetic.
  * **Poetic**: Music is poetry for the ears. The writing itself should sound musical. Alliteration and rhyme are great written musical devices.
  * **Honest**: I want to inspire trust in the readers. I want them to trust that this story is true. It will help them absorb it more easily (lower barrier to entry.)
  * **Humble**: I don&#8217;t want to sound like a know-it-all. I want readers to feel a sense of awe, so if I write in a way where I have a sense of awe, readers will catch on to that and empathize.
  * **Progressive**: No sexist comments; Madonna&#8217;s success is not &#8220;incredible, for a woman.&#8221; It is just that: incredible. I&#8217;ll write in a way that does not demean, reduce, or objectify the artist to placate my own ego or reduce the artist in the eyes of the reader.

### Identify the Customer Persona

Who&#8217;s going to be reading Madonna&#8217;s bio?

Madonna fan: _&#8220;I love Madonna, she&#8217;s awesome.&#8221;_

Variety-seeker: _&#8220;I&#8217;m open to listening to all kind of music. I&#8217;ve heard Madonna before.&#8221;_

Genre fan: _&#8220;I want to hear new artists in my favorite genre. Maybe Madonna will show up in my list.&#8221; _

New music seeker: _&#8220;I actively want to find new artists and refreshing music. If one of those is Madonna, let&#8217;s hear it.&#8221;_

### Identify the objective of the copy

Artist biographies should inspire appreciation, respect, love, and attachment to musical groups. It should inspire respect and trust as well in the Pandora product, so users continue using the Pandora streaming service:

_&#8220;Pandora has awesome music. I really feel like I can connect to the artists, they have great music and I love reading their stories. I&#8217;m definitely going to stay as a customer, I&#8217;m getting great cultural value.&#8221;_

## Review Existing Content and Edit Voice and Tone

Let&#8217;s take a look at the existing copy. Pandora subscribers can <a href="https://www.pandora.com/madonna?bio" target="_blank">find the full text here</a>. An excerpt from the beginning of the article has been posted here for educational purposes, and for the purposes of critique:

> After stars reach a certain point, it&#8217;s easy to forget what they became famous for and concentrate solely on their personas. Madonna is such a star. She rocketed to stardom so quickly in 1984 that it obscured most of her musical virtues. Appreciating her music became even more difficult as the decade wore on, as discussing her lifestyle became more common. However, one of Madonna&#8217;s greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality. Arguably, Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image.

The tone of the text is that of sadness, and the voice is passive. I think to myself:

_&#8220;How unfortunate for her: her virtues were obscured, her music worsened over time, and her great contribution to society was manipulating the media and the public. People just seemed to discuss her lifestyle instead of her music. I guess Madonna isn&#8217;t that great. Does she even deserve to be a star?&#8221;_ 

As a reader, I would not want to connect or form an emotional attachment to a character with that in mind. I would not be so sure that Pandora is delivering the quality that I have come to expect.

### Copy mismatch with user; copy blocks service objective

The gloomy, weary mood of the writing does not match the engaged, curious user persona of our supposed customer persona. I, the user, am open to forming emotional attachments; the copy works against that. The writing actively discredits the artist using a passive voice, despite any good intentions:

&#8220;Appreciating her music became more difficult &#8230;&#8221; (Passive voice)

&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to forget what [she] became famous for &#8230;&#8221; (Reduces the artist)

&#8220;She manipulated the media and the public &#8230; &#8221; (Objectifies the artist; not poetic)

&#8220;Arguably&#8230;&#8221; (Passive voice)

Is there _anything_ positive about the artist in this opening? The first few sentences of any written piece are critical for capturing attention and emotional interest. We want to fill it with active, positive, energetic, awe-inspiring statements like

&#8220;Madonna is an extremely successful female pop star. Her first album was certified five times platinum by the RIAA &#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;She has empowered women fans everywhere with her feminist image &#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Madonna is recognized as the world&#8217;s best-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records.&#8221; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_albums_discography" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>

&#8220;Madonna is an active philanthropist: she supports over 29 charities. In 2005, she co-founded Raising Malawi, a non-profit organization supporting community-based organizations that provide vulnerable children and caregivers with nutritious food, proper clothing, secure shelter, formal education, targeted medical care, emotional care and psychosocial support.&#8221; <a href="https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/madonna" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>

Let&#8217;s get to work.

The first word should be &#8220;Madonna.&#8221; Right to the point (Energetic, honest).

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;Madonna is an extremely successful female pop star.&#8221;
</p>

Energetic, honest.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;She holds the Guinness World Record for best-selling female recording artist of all time, with over <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-female-recording-artist">300 million records sold</a>.&#8221;
</p>

Progressive, factual, but it could be a bit more compelling. Don&#8217;t want it to sound like she got there without merit.
