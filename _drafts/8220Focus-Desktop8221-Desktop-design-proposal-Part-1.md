I propose a new set of rules for applications to follow and standards of application focus in a system I call the "Focus Desktop Environment."

<!--more-->

Mission statement:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>The mission of Focus Desktop Environment (Focus DE)<br /> </strong><strong>is to preserve the user's focus on their active task<br /> andÂ <em>never</em> disrupt it.</strong>
</p>

Mainstream: Use popups or alerts to get the user's attention
FocusDE: Alerts are contained in the context of the application window

Mainstream: New windows overlap the active window and the focus goes to it
FocusDE: The active window always stays on top and the focus stays with it

Mainstream: Alerts from another application overlap the active application
FocusDE: Alerts from other applications cannot overlap the active application

Mainstream: There is a "hot" corner for custom notifications from any application
FocusDE: Applications are not permitted to broadcast alerts to any region on the desktop
FocusDE: Applications can instead stream notifications to a Notification Center

Mainstream: Application windows can only be moved by clicking and dragging on a titlebar region
FocusDE: Applications can be moved by pressing a "move window" key modifier and click-dragging a window

Mainstream: Moving application windows is mouse-driven
FocusDE: Applications can be moved using just keyboard

Mainstream: System notifications appear anywhere
FocusDE: System notifications are restricted to the "System" application, which reports all issues with the machine to the user
FocusDE: System notifications are streamed to a system notification tray icon

Mainstream: Application taskbar icons "bounce" continuously when there is activity
FocusDE: Applications may temporarily display a notification, such as unread mail counter increment

Mainstream: Application window focus changes with mouse click
FocusDE: Application window focus changes with mouse hover after a user-specified period of time (like Gnome desktop)

Mainstream: All system and application keyboard shortcuts are enabled to first-time users immediately
FocusDE: Users learn keyboard shortcuts over time and self-select when they are ready for more shortcuts

Mainstream: Maybe new users get some kind of walkthrough, it'll need internet though
FocusDE: A FocusDE offline help book is always available for all levels of users with computing experience

Mainstream: Function keys provide fixed behavior, typically hardware interactions
FocusDE: Function keys can be set to do whatever the user prefers. There is even a function key manager app

Mainstream: Some dialogues require mouse interaction
FocusDE: All dialogues can be completed using keyboard interactions only
