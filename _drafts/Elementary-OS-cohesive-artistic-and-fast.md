I really enjoy Elementary OS. It&#8217;s a fabulous, cohesive desktop experience.Â I want to feel like I&#8217;m interacting with layers of art, intention, and to know just by looking that someone else wanted me to have a good time using their application.

Elementary OS is a fabulous desktop experience. It is a pixel-perfect plethora of good design choices: apps behave in expected ways. Apps can be found in one place. They are added in one place. And so on.

Best of all, Elementary OS is free. The development team is promoting it as an alternative operating system that can be used on Mac systems. Being savvy, I installed Elementary OS on my 2009 iMac, because the latest version of Mac OS turned my perfectly fine iMac into a master class on Making Users Wait to Do Simple Tasks Like Clicking.
