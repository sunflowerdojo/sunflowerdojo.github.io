I&#8217;m a software developer with a background in startups and the arts. I&#8217;ve worn many hats and I&#8217;ve landed at software developer because I enjoy using tech to &#8220;make life easier&#8221; for people and as a creator I like the blend of artistic and technical challenges that this role holds. Software can be a powerful force for positive, civic change when done well, and when done poorly or in service to unethical forces, destroys public trust and well-being.

The software world is plagued with inconsistencies and pain. Bugs in large pieces of enterprise software sit around for years and years. &#8220;Surely I can do better than that!&#8221;
